Good SEO is a powerful tool for building your brand's online presence. By ranking well on Google, you can attract more traffic, increase sales, and gain more opportunities as a business owner, influencer, or developer. In this post, I'll share five essential SEO elements you must include in your website to get more engagement and visibility.

### Title

- **Be descriptive and relevant:** Use your targeted keywords in the title to help search engines understand your content's topic and improve your ranking.
- **Make it compelling:** Write a title that entices users to click on your page and shows the value of your content.
- **Keep it unique:** A unique title will make your content stand out and won't confuse search engines.
- **Character limit:** Google typically displays the first 50-60 characters of a title tag. To ensure your title is fully visible in search results, aim to keep it within this limit.

### Description

- **Summarize the content:** Use 1-2 sentences to summarize your content and help readers understand what they can expect after clicking the link.
- **Include target keywords:** Use your targeted keywords in a natural and non-spammy way to help search engines understand the relevance of your content to specific search queries.
- **Character limit:** Aim for a description length of approximately 140-160 characters, as search engines like Google typically display this amount.

**_Note:_** Avoid using the keywords meta tag, as Google stopped using it for ranking purposes in 2009, and it may have potential negative effects.

### Open Graph

When implementing Open Graph meta tags for your blog post, consider the following essential tags to optimize how your content is displayed when shared on social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter (if Twitter Cards are absent):

- **og:title:** This tag defines the title of your content as it appears when shared on social media. Make sure it's descriptive and relevant to your content.

- **og:description:** This tag provides a brief summary of your content, which is displayed below the title when shared on social media. Keep it engaging and include target keywords.

- **og:image:** This tag specifies the image that will be displayed alongside your content when shared on social media. Choose a high-quality, relevant image to entice users to click on your post.

- **og:type:** Use the "website" type for blog posts to specify the type of content being shared.

- **og:url:** This tag defines the canonical URL of your blog post, ensuring that all traffic from your shares goes to the correct URL, especially if you have multiple URLs for the same content.

### Twitter

When implementing Twitter meta tags for your blog post, consider the following essential tags to optimize how your content is displayed when shared on Twitter:

- **twitter:card:** This tag defines the type of Twitter Card you want to use. For blog posts, you can use "summary" or "summary_large_image" depending on whether you want a small or large image to be displayed.

- **twitter:title:** This tag sets the title of your content as it appears when shared on Twitter. Make sure it's descriptive and relevant to your blog post.

- **twitter:description:** This tag provides a brief summary of your content, which is displayed below the title when shared on Twitter. Keep it engaging and include target keywords.

- **twitter:image:** This tag specifies the image that will be displayed alongside your content when shared on Twitter. Choose a high-quality, relevant image and provide the full path to the image.

- **twitter:site and twitter:creator:** These tags attribute the content to your Twitter handle and the author's Twitter handle, respectively.

### Robots

- **Index and follow:** This will instruct search engines to index the content and follow the links on the page.

Remember that the robots meta tag should not be used instead of a robots.txt file, as they serve different purposes. While the robots.txt file controls crawling, the robots meta tag controls indexing.

In conclusion, implementing these 5 essential SEO elements - title, description, Open Graph, Twitter, and Robots - can greatly enhance the visibility of your brand and content online. By optimizing these elements, you can improve your ranking on Google, increase engagement on social media, and ultimately drive more traffic to your website.
